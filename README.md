# Emailization

This is a Google App Engine app I built with Django (nonrel) so you can receive email in your web app as a POST request without having to set up a mail server or do other tricks.  You can use it at [emailization.com](http://www.emailization.com).  If its not doing what you want you should change for your needs!  
Check the [faq](http://www.emailization.com/faq) on the site to see more about it.
